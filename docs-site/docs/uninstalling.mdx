# Uninstalling

Remove Mystral Native.js from your system.

## Quick Uninstall

If you installed via the install script (`curl ... | bash`), run:

```bash
# Remove the install directory
rm -rf ~/.mystral

# Remove PATH entry from your shell config
# (The installer adds a line like: export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.mystral")
```

Then remove the PATH line from your shell configuration file:

### Bash

```bash
# Edit ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_profile)
nano ~/.bashrc
# Find and delete the lines:
#   # MystralNative
#   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.mystral"
```

### Zsh

```bash
# Edit ~/.zshrc
nano ~/.zshrc
# Find and delete the lines:
#   # MystralNative
#   export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.mystral"
```

### Fish

```bash
# Edit ~/.config/fish/config.fish
nano ~/.config/fish/config.fish
# Find and delete the line:
#   set -gx PATH $PATH $HOME/.mystral
```

## One-Liner

Remove everything in one command (bash/zsh):

```bash
rm -rf ~/.mystral && sed -i.bak '/# MystralNative/d;/\.mystral/d' ~/.zshrc ~/.bashrc 2>/dev/null
```

On macOS, `sed -i` requires a backup extension (`.bak`). You can delete the backup files after:

```bash
rm -f ~/.zshrc.bak ~/.bashrc.bak
```

## Custom Install Directory

If you installed to a custom directory via `MYSTRAL_INSTALL_DIR`, remove that directory instead:

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/your/install/dir
```

And remove the corresponding PATH entry from your shell config.

## Verify

After restarting your terminal, confirm it's removed:

```bash
which mystral
# Should return nothing or "mystral not found"
```

## Manual Download

If you downloaded a prebuilt binary manually (not via the install script), just delete the extracted directory:

```bash
rm -rf mystral-macOS-arm64-v8-dawn/
```

## Build from Source

If you built from source, remove the cloned repository:

```bash
rm -rf mystralnative/
```

If you installed the binary system-wide:

```bash
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/mystral
```
